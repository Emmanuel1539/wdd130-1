      <h2>Belfast</h2>
      <img src="images/belfast.webp" alt="Belfast city">
      <p>Belfast, the capital and largest city of Northern Ireland, is located on the River Lagan and has a rich industrial history, once being a major center for linen manufacturing and shipbuilding. Originally chartered in 1613, it grew rapidly through the influx of Scottish Presbyterians and became a focal point of sectarian tensions, particularly during the 20th century. Today, Belfast is a thriving city with a growing services sector, including fintech, tourism, and film, and continues to be a key port with a unique position in both the British and European trade areas. It is home to two major universities and has been recognized as a UNESCO City of Music since 2021.</p>
